# Hello, World!

This is my project template for my cross-platform Swift packages.
It includes an Xcode project with targets for iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS.

To create a new project, clone this repo, run `rename-project.sh` with a nice new name, then start typing!

You'll probably want to delete `.git` and start fresh with `git init` before committing anything, though.
